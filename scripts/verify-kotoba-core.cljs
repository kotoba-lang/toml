;; verify-kotoba-core.cljs — run `kotoba/toml_scan_core.kotoba` and check what
;; it actually answers.
;;
;; The module compiles to a `kotoba-js-artifact/v1` ESM. Compiling needs the
;; Kotoba compiler (`kotoba-lang/amu`, which needs a JVM); RUNNING the result
;; needs only node, which is why this runner is nbb and takes the artifact path
;; rather than building it.
;;
;;   kotoba -M compile kotoba/toml_scan_core.kotoba --target js --output core.mjs
;;   nbb scripts/verify-kotoba-core.cljs core.mjs
;;
;; ## One instance per case, deliberately
;;
;; A Kotoba module carries 512 function-entry charges for the WHOLE LIFE of an
;; instance and never replenishes them (kotoba-lang/compiler,
;; backend/cljs.clj: "permanently exhausted after 512 total function calls
;; across its whole lifetime -- not 512 per top-level call"; WASM has the same
;; module-global counter). Measured 2026-08-11: one instance sustained seven
;; `line-kind` calls on an 8-byte line before trapping `fuel-exhausted`.
;;
;; So each case gets a fresh instance. That is not a test trick — it is the
;; reason this core does not yet drive `check-metadata`, whose real input has a
;; ~500-character line that exceeds the budget inside a single call. The cases
;; below are sized to fit; the limit is recorded in the README.
